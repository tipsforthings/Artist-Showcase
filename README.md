Artist Showcase
===

The Artist Showcase theme is designed to be just that, an artist showcase. It is meant for musicians to be able to upload audio files with covers and display custom pages of tracks. You can display by album, genre, artist (if using multiple artists). Each track can hold additional meta data including iTunes purchase link, Soundcloud link, website url, etc. 

The reason this has been released as a theme, is that it provides the whole structure for an artist site, including the upload functionality as well as playback functionality. The playback functionality is implemented using the SoundManager2 library, which gives us full HTML5 playback with a flash fallback. The use of flash allows us access to some valuable audio data including peaks and waveforms, which can and will be used in various different player options that will be available in this theme by the end of the project.

Getting Started
---------------

Just install the theme and you will see the custom post types for tracks in the admin menu. Upload your tracks here and configure the player options from within the theme customizer, including the player skin, colours, etc.

You can add menu items to your pages in the customizer, as well as the player widget. The theme also features a special built-in top bar player which can be enabled. When this is enabled, any tracks that are viewed within the site can be added to the playlist for the top bar player, or played immediately. If a track is played immediately, this will clear any existing items within the playlist.

Good luck!
